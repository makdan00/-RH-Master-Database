# -RH-Master-Database
## -Project Overview
This is a high-performance database designed to run the Remote Hustle Database Challenge (RHDC) without the mess. It replaces slow spreadsheets with a fast, secure, and "smart" system that tracks participants, grades their work, and catches mistakes automatically.
## -The Tech Stack (What I used)
Database: PostgreSQL (The "Brain")

Hosting: Supabase (The "Cloud Home")

Data Generation: Python (The "Robot" that made the test data)

Design: Relational Modeling (The "Map")
