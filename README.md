# 🏆 RH-Master-Database: High-Integrity Engine
## Project Overview
This is a high-performance PostgreSQL database designed to power the Remote Hustle Database Challenge (RHDC). It replaces fragile spreadsheets with a secure, automated system that tracks participants, manages submissions, and enforces grading rules at the database level.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
Database: PostgreSQL (Core Engine)

Hosting: Supabase (Cloud Infrastructure)

Security: Row Level Security (RLS) & Security Invoker Views

Automation: PL/pgSQL Triggers & Functions

Data Generation: Python (Faker library for realistic scale)

## 🏗️ How it Works (The "Smart" Features)
The Skeleton (Schema): 8 normalized tables connected via strict Foreign Keys to ensure zero data orphans.

The Safety Rails (Constraints): Hardcoded rules prevent scores > 100, duplicate emails, or invalid roles.

The Secret Diary (Audit Logs): Automated PostgreSQL Triggers capture every INSERT and UPDATE into an audit trail, ensuring 100% transparency.

Production Security: Every table is protected by Row Level Security (RLS), and the leaderboard view is hardened with security_invoker to prevent unauthorized data leaks.

## 🚀 Ready-to-Run Queries
Test the logic yourself in the Supabase SQL Editor:

1. The Live Leaderboard (Secure View)
Who is currently winning?

SQL
SELECT * FROM leaderboard LIMIT 10;

2. The Audit Trail (Trigger-Powered)
Show the last 5 automated logs generated by the system.

SQL
SELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY changed_at DESC LIMIT 5;

3. Real-Time Grading Check
Find completed submissions that still need a judge's review.

SQL
SELECT * FROM submissions WHERE status = 'completed';
